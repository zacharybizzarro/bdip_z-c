	<h1 id="h1-1">Our Patent Expertise</h1>
	<h2>Patent Litigation</h2>
	<p>
	We have significant experience litigating patent cases in district courts throughout the United States and before the International Trade Commission.
	The two name partners have over 50 years of patent litigation experience, and have collectively tried well over 50 cases to verdict. We put this experience to work, and our associates are trained to litigate patent cases efficiently and effectively to achieve our clients&#x27; objectives. While we are trained technologists, we are litigators first, and understand what it takes to deliver a win.
</p>
	<h2>Portfolios & Licensing</h2>
	<p>Not all patents are created equal. We have the experience to assess the validity and extent-of-use of patents and larger portfolios, and recommend strategies for licensing and enforcement, or to secure your freedom to operate.  We are able to analyze and recommend licensing terms and strategies for businesses of all sizes.</p>
	<h2>Post-Grant Review</h2>
	<p>FPatent Office post-grant review proceedings, including Inter-Partes Review (IPR), Covered Business Method (CBM), and reexamination proceedings are increasingly popular vehicles to challenge the validity of issued U.S. patents. Our attorneys are prepared to handle these proceedings on behalf of challengers and patent holders.</p>

	<h1 id="h1-1">Our Trademark Expertise</h1>
	<h2>Trademark Litigation</h2>
	<p>
	Your brands and trademarks should set you (and only you) apart from the competition. Enforcement is often necessary to preserve the integrity of your marks. Our attorneys are experienced trademark litigators, and have helped the nation&#x27;s top brands enforce their trademarks in federal and state courts.
</p>
	<h2>Brand Protection</h2>
<p>
	Successful brand protection programs do not rely on litigation alone. Let us help develop policies regarding the use, licensing, and enforcement of your trademarks and branding. We can recommend approaches for policing unauthorized use and removing offending products from the market.
</p>
	<h2>Identity Management</h2>
<p>
	Along with the spotlight comes the need to protect the rights of publicity and persona, and prevent unauthoried use or suggestions of endorsement. Whether preserving your own legacy, or protecting the rights of the deceased, our attorneys are prepared to protect and enforce your publicity and privacy rights.

	<h2>Copyright Litigation</h2>
<p>
	Whether your creations have been used without permission, or you&#x27;re wrongly accused of misuse, we are here to help. We understand the balance between prohibited and fair uses, and have the expertise to explain these complex issues to judges and juries.
</p>
	<h2>Strategic Counseling</h2>
<p>
	Is copyright protection appropriate? When and how should copyrights be registered? What protections are available overseas?
	We provide guidance and counseling to ensure that your creations are protected and that unauthorized use is actionable.
</p>
	<h2>Licensing & Protection</h2>
	<p>Formulating a licensing strategy and navigating license agreements requires careful consideration. We provide insight on approaches consistent with your business needs and objectives. And we can help police for misuse, including through administrative enforcement actions or litigation.

<p>
	<b>Formulas. Algorithms. Contacts. Recipes. Lists.</b>
	<br><br>
	Certain aspects of your business are best kept secret. But threats lurk in every corner: rogue employees, unscrupulous vendors, corporate spies.

	Our attorneys can help formulate policies and procedures to help protect your critical know-how. By implementing procedural and physical safeguards, NDA execution and auditing, and robust enforcement practices, it is possible to achieve protection for your trade secrets.

	We are also experienced in trade secret enforcement, including cease-and-desist orders, take-down notices, restraining orders, litigation, and arbitration.

	<h1 id="h1-1">Our Trade Secret Expertise</h1>
	<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>
	When trade secrets are misappropriated, immediate action is needed to mitigate potential damages. Our attorneys will initiate or respond to take-down and cease-and-desist requests, handle requests for immediate relief, and formulate a longer-term strategy. Often, an immediate response can reduce the need for protracted litigation or court intervention.
</p>
	<h2>Litigation & Arbitration</h2>
<p>
	Our attorneys have significant experience initiating and defending trade secret claims, including those resulting from unscrupulous vendors, spurned business partners, and transitioning personnel. Whether you&#x27;re in need of enforcement or defense, we can help. 
</p>
	<h2>Strategic Planning</h2>
<p>
	Protection is not one-size-fits-all. We can help you decide the right approach for your industry and specific business needs. And we can develop programs to ensure that your trade secrets will qualify for protection, and that appropriate measures are in place, including: non-compete, non-solicitation, and non-disclosure agreements.

<p>
	<b>We Understand Balance</b>
	<br><br>
	Data Security and Privacy represent ever-evolving aspects of nearly every business (at least they should). And they present ever-evolving risks, as regulators issue piecemeal and contradictory guidance that&#x27;s usually outdated.

	Combat the uncertainty with robust data security and privacy policies that ensure Security and Privacy by Design. We understand technology and business, and can help implement or overhaul your security and privacy frameworks.
	<br><br>
	And if things go sideways, we&#x27;re here to help.

	<h1 id="h1-1">Our Data Security & Privacy Expertise</h1>
	<h2>Policy Implementation</h2>
	<p>

	Policies that promote security and privacy by design are more likely to meet the test of time, and provide guidance for all aspects of your organization to help avoid legal risk and regulatory oversight. Vendors, business partners, and regulators increasingly require transparency as a condition of doing business.

	Our attorneys can create or update policies that account for evolving legal requirements.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Vulnerability Issues</h2>
<p>
	Vulnerability reports must be taken seriously. At the same time, penetration testers and security researchers must tread lightly to avoid accusations of impropriety.

	We are well-versed in federal and state data security and trespass laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and state computer trespass laws. We are prepared to assist in pursuing or defending against such claims.
 </p>
	<h2>Response & Mitigation</h2>
<p>
	Over 47 states have enacted state data breach notification laws, some of which including contrary or conflicting requirements. Federal HIPAA imposes additional obligations on health care industry participants and their business associates. 
	We help consumers and businesses navigate these requirements to ensure that best practices for data breach response, mitigation, and notification are followed.
